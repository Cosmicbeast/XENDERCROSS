## Project Overview

This project is a submission for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**.

*   **Team Name:** XENDERCROSS
*   **Problem Statement ID:** 25080
*   **Problem Statement Title:** Document Overload at Kochi Metro Rail Limited
*   **Theme:** Smart Automation
*   **Category:** Software

## The Problem

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) faces significant challenges with document overload and inefficient asset management. [2] This leads to:
*   **Slow Decision-Making:** Critical information is buried in emails, PDFs, and scattered files. [2]
*   **Drained Productivity:** Staff spend hours skimming documents instead of performing core duties. [2]
*   **Increased Risks:** Poorly tracked maintenance and buried regulatory updates expose KMRL to safety and audit failures. [2]
*   **Higher Operational Costs:** Inefficiencies in document and asset handling jeopardize service reliability and increase costs. [2]

## The Solution: KMRL Docuzone

We propose **KMRL Docuzone**, a centralized platform designed to streamline document management, asset tracking, and maintenance workflows. Our solution transforms operations at KMRL to be **Smarter, Faster, and Better**. [2] It provides a single source of truth for all operational data, from fault reports to personnel schedules.

## Key Features

*   **Centralized Dashboard:** Real-time overview of total assets, active faults, maintenance schedules, and system availability.
*   **Asset Management:** Monitor and manage all railway assets, from rolling stock to infrastructure.
*   **Fault Reporting & Tracking:** A dedicated system to report, track, and resolve asset faults efficiently.
*   **Maintenance Management:** Schedule, track, and manage all maintenance activities to ensure operational readiness.
*   **Analytics & Reporting:** Generate detailed reports and gain insights from performance dashboards on system uptime, efficiency, and trends.
*   **Personnel Management:** Manage staff schedules, assignments, and department distributions.
*   **AI-Powered Document Hub:** Centralizes documents with intelligent search, AI-summarization, and automated workflows. [4, 6]
